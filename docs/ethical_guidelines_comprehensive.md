# Ethical Guidelines for Security Corpus Collection and LLM Training

## Overview

The Security Corpus Harvesting Pipeline is designed to collect and prepare security-related data for Large Language Model (LLM) training. This document establishes comprehensive ethical guidelines to ensure responsible development, deployment, and use of security-focused AI systems.

## Core Ethical Principles

### 1. Educational Purpose Only

**Principle**: All harvested data and trained models must be used exclusively for educational and research purposes.

**Implementation**:
- Clear labeling of all datasets with educational use restrictions
- Built-in ethical context in every training sample
- Documentation emphasizing learning objectives
- Prohibition of commercial exploitation without proper authorization

**Compliance Measures**:
- Regular audits of dataset usage
- License agreements requiring educational use attestation
- Monitoring of model deployment contexts

### 2. Authorized Use Requirement

**Principle**: Security tools and techniques must only be applied with explicit written authorization.

**Implementation**:
- Mandatory authorization disclaimers in training data
- Emphasis on penetration testing standards and protocols
- Clear guidance on obtaining proper permissions
- Examples of appropriate authorization documentation

**Key Requirements**:
- Written permission from system owners
- Clearly defined scope of authorized activities
- Time-limited authorization periods
- Regular reauthorization for ongoing activities

### 3. Responsible Disclosure

**Principle**: All vulnerability research must follow responsible disclosure practices.

**Implementation**:
- Training samples include disclosure timeline examples
- Emphasis on coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD)
- Guidelines for working with vendor security teams
- Best practices for minimizing harm during disclosure

**Disclosure Framework**:
1. **Discovery**: Identify and validate security issues
2. **Vendor Notification**: Inform affected parties promptly
3. **Collaboration**: Work with vendors on remediation
4. **Public Disclosure**: Share findings only after remediation or agreed timeline

### 4. Legal Compliance

**Principle**: All activities must comply with applicable laws and regulations.

**Implementation**:
- Regular legal review of training content
- Country-specific legal guidance where applicable
- Clear warnings about legal restrictions
- Resources for understanding cybersecurity law

**Legal Considerations**:
- Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) compliance
- International cybercrime laws
- Data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA)
- Export control regulations for security tools

## Data Collection Ethics

### Source Legitimacy

**Requirement**: Only collect data from legitimate, publicly available sources.

**Approved Sources**:

- Published academic research
- Vendor security advisories
- Public security conference presentations

**Prohibited Sources**:
- Private or confidential security research
- Leaked or stolen security tools
- Malicious software or exploits
- Underground forums or marketplaces

### Privacy Protection

**Principle**: Protect individual privacy and sensitive organizational information.

**Implementation**:
- Anonymization of personal identifiers
- Removal of internal system information
- Protection of proprietary security measures
- Respect for researcher attribution while protecting privacy

### Intellectual Property Respect

**Principle**: Respect intellectual property rights and licensing terms.

**Implementation**:
- Compliance with open source licenses
- Proper attribution of research and tools
- Respect for proprietary software limitations
- Clear documentation of licensing requirements
